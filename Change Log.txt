I fixed two errors in EKI_DMC.m.
The situations in which these errors occur are not included in any of the models shown in the paper, so nothing in the paper was affected.
1) The equation I had for calculationg Phi(j) on line 71 was previously only correct if Gamma is a diagonal matrix.
I have now fixed this.
2) In the calculation of Cplus on line 253, in the KalmanGain_sub_low function, I divided this equation by (N-1).
This is done because C in Evensen (2004) is actually (N-1) times the (CnGG+alpha*Gamma) term that I need to take the inverse of, so I need to divide Cplus by (N-1) to actually get (CnGG+alpha*Gamma).
