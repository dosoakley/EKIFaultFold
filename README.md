# EKIFaultFold
Three-dimensional, multi-fault modelling of fault-related deformation with Ensemble Kalman Inversion

This program uses Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) and a three-dimensional kinematic model (Georgsen et al., 2012, Fault displacement modelling using 3D vector fields) to build three-dimensional models of geologic structures, which can include multiple faults and complex fault geometries and distributions of slip on the faults.

This work was carried out while I was a postdoc from Sept. 2020 to Sept. 2022 at the Department of Energy Resources, University of Stavanger, Norway, working together with Nestor Cardozo. This work is currently in preparation to be published. An earlier version of it was presented at the EGU 2022 conference, and that abstract can be found here: https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU22/EGU22-5823.html

Requirements: Matlab, parallel computing toolbox
