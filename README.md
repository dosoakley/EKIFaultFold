# EKIFaultFold
Three-dimensional, multi-fault modelling of fault-related deformation with Ensemble Kalman Inversion

This program uses Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) and a three-dimensional kinematic model (Georgsen et al., 2012, Fault displacement modelling using 3D vector fields) to build three-dimensional models of geologic structures, which can include multiple faults and complex fault geometries and distributions of slip on the faults.

This work was carried out while I was a postdoc from Sept. 2020 to Sept. 2022 at the Department of Energy Resources, University of Stavanger, Norway, working together with Nestor Cardozo. It is described in the paper:

Requirements: Matlab, parallel computing toolbox
