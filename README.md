Three-dimensional modelling of fault-related deformation with Ensemble Kalman Inversion

This program uses Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) and a three-dimensional kinematic model (Georgsen et al., 2012) to build three-dimensional models of geologic structures which can include multiple faults and complex fault geometries and distributions of slip on the faults.

This work is currently in preparation to be published. An earlier version of it was presented at the EGU 2022 conference, and that abstract can be found here: https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU22/EGU22-5823.html
